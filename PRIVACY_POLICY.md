- Your dreams never leave your device

### On-Device AI Processing

- No dream content is sent to external AI services or third-party servers
- AI processing happens entirely on your device using Apple Intelligence

### No Account Required
- NightTales does not require you to create an account
- We do not collect email addresses, names, or any personal identifiers
- Premium purchases are managed through Apple's App Store without requiring additional sign-up

## Data We Don't Collect

We **do not** collect, store, or have access to:
- Dream content or interpretations
- Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Location data
- Device identifiers beyond what Apple requires for App Store purchases

## In-App Purchases

## Data Export and Deletion

- You can export your dream data as a JSON file at any time
- You have full control to delete all your data from the app
- When you delete the app, all data is permanently removed from your device

## Third-Party Services

NightTales does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

NightTales does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Since all data is stored locally on the device and we collect no personal information, the app can be used by individuals of any age under parental supervision.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on our repository. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
